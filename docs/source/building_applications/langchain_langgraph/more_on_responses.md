# Deep dive references for Llama Stack, OpenAI Responses API, and LangChain/LangGraph

Examples for dealing with combinations the LLama Stack Client API with say:
- OpenAI Responses API
- And a wide variety of frameworks, such as the LangChain API

are rapidly evolving throughout various code repositories, blogs, and documentations sites.

The list of scenarios included at such location are impossible to list and keep current, but for certain the
minimally include such scenarios as:
- Simple model inference
- RAG with document search
- Tool calling to MCP
- Complex multi-step workflows.

Rather then duplicate these Llama Stack Client related examples in this documentation site, this section will provide
references to these external sites.
